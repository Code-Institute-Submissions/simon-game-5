# Simon game

 Based on the famous electronic game of memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison. 
 The game works by highlighting buttons and playing their corresponding sounds for a brief period of time in a random squence. 
 The user then has to repeat this sequence to progress to the next level. The game is won by completing all 20 levels.
 
 ## Features
 
 * 6 buttons  2 more than in the original game for an added challenge  with unique colors and sounds.
 * 20 levels.
 * 2 game modes:
    * Normal mode selected with the `start` button where a user can make a mistake 3 times before losing the game.
    * Strict mode selected with the `strict` button where a single mistake means game over and the user has to 
      start from scratch.
